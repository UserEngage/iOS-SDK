# iOS-SDK

## Installation

Create Podfile and add pod 'UserSDK':

```ruby
use_frameworks!

target 'YourApp' do
    pod 'UserSDK'
end

post_install do |installer|
   installer.pods_project.targets.each do |target|
      if target.name == 'Starscream'
         target.build_configurations.each do |config|
            config.build_settings['BUILD_LIBRARY_FOR_DISTRIBUTION']='YES'
        end        
      end
   end
end
```

Install pods:

```ruby
$ pod install
```

Import the module:

```Swift
import UserSDK
```

## In-app messages custom fonts

If you want to support custom fonts in new in-apps sent from user.com you have to create a type conforming to protocol FontResolving. 
```
protocol FontResolving {
	func resolvingFontFor(name: String, size: CGFloat) -> UIFont?
}
```
When ready assign instance of the type to fontResolver property on UserSDK just like below:
```
UserSDK.default?.fontResolver = FontResolver()
```
Where FontResolver is a type conforming to FontResoving. As always keep in mind to initialize the UserSDK before assignment of the fontResolver.
